        <h2>Cooking Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Place chicken in air fryer. Set to 385°F for 15 mins</li>
            <li>In a large pan on medium heat, spray a nominal amount
                of cooking oil.
            </li>
            <li>Once oil reaches 300°F or it's been a few minutes, place
                tortilla on pan.
            </li>
            <li>After the bottom of the tortilla turns a light golden-
                brown, flip over tortilla.
            </li>
            <li>Add shredded cheese spread evenly atop the tortilla.</li>
            <li>Add one-third of the chopped onion spread evenly
                atop the tortilla.
            </li>
            <li>Generously sprinkle seasonings onto the onion and cheese.</li>
            <li>Spray a small amount of cooking oil onto the tortilla</li>
            <li>After a few mintues, check the bottom of the tortilla. Once
                golden-brown, lift tortilla and re-spray pan with small
                amount of cooking oil, then flip tortilla so the melted
                cheese and onion are faced down.
            </li>
            <li>Lower heat to three-quarters of the way toward medium.</li>
            <li>Remove cooked chicken from air fryer and chop into
                small cubes (or your desired shape).
            </li>
            <li>After the cheese has cooked for five minutes, place a 
                plate nearby. Flip the cooked tortilla upside down onto
                the plate. Gently scrape any excess cheese remaining on the
                pan onto the plated tortilla.
            </li>
            <li>Add the chopped, cooked chicken onto half of the finished
                tortilla. Pour the ranch lightly onto the chicken-side.
            </li>
            <li>Fold the other half of the tortilla over onto the chicken-
                side. Cut into three-to-four triangles. Serve warm.
            </li>
